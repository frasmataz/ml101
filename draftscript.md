# Intro to NN

## How are our brains structured?

## How does this differ from traditional computing?
 - PATTERNS
 - Allows behaviours to emerge from patterns
 - Has no definite behaviour

## How do we model this machine?

 - Simplify

### The feedforward network


## So, how do we make this learn?

#### Natural selection

#### Backpropagation


## So that's great, but there are limitations

 - For a trained network, a set of inputs match exactly one set of outputs.  It will always do the same thing for an input, with no regard for what came before.

 - Data points are isolated, each being treated completely separately to other data points.  We have no flexibility in input the structure or amount of input data.

## Other network models

#### LSTM - Long short-term memory

Temporal data

#### CNN - Convolutional neural networks

2D data

#### GAN - Generative adversarial networks

2D data.. but cooler
